## Risk Assessment

### Top 5 Risks by Severity

1. **MEDIUM: Voice Provider Costs**
   - Risk: $0.10-0.30/user/day could exceed budget
   - Mitigation: Implement usage caps, optimize caching, consider offline mode expansion

2. **LOW: Active Job State Persistence**
   - Risk: Implementation ambiguity
   - Mitigation: Define storage location before development starts

3. **LOW: Third-Party Service Resilience**
   - Risk: No explicit circuit breakers
   - Mitigation: Add circuit breaker pattern for voice/payment providers

4. **LOW: Schema Migration Execution**
   - Risk: Migration workflow not detailed
   - Mitigation: Document step-by-step migration process

5. **LOW: Language Support Scope**
   - Risk: German mentioned but not in PRD
   - Mitigation: Clarify MVP language requirements

**Timeline Impact:** Minimal - all risks can be addressed during implementation

---

## Recommendations

### Must-Fix Before Development
1. **Specify active job state storage** - Add `activeJobId` to user preferences document
2. **Add exportTenantData Cloud Function** - Complete FR23 specification
3. **Clarify language scope** - Confirm cs/en only for MVP

### Should-Fix for Better Quality
1. **Add circuit breaker patterns** - For voice and payment providers
2. **Document migration execution** - Step-by-step workflow
3. **Create visual dashboard mockups** - For performance monitoring

### Nice-to-Have Improvements
1. **Expand offline voice capabilities** - Local pattern matching
2. **Add cost optimization dashboard** - Real-time provider cost tracking
3. **Create architecture decision records** - For future reference
