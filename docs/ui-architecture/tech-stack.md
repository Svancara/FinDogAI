## Technology Rationale

### Angular 20+
**Why Angular?**
- **Enterprise-grade framework** with strong TypeScript support

- **Built-in PWA support** through @angular/pwa
- **Excellent tooling** with Angular CLI and DevTools
- **Long-term support** and regular updates from Google

**Key Features Used:**
- Signals for reactive state management
- Standalone components and directives
- `inject()` function for cleaner dependency injection
- Control flow syntax (@if, @for, @switch)
- Improved hydration for better initial load

### Ionic Framework 8+
**Why Ionic?**
- **Native-feel UI components** optimized for mobile
- **PWA capabilities** built-in
- **Platform-specific styling** (iOS vs Android)
- **Touch-optimized components** crucial for field work
- **Capacitor integration** for native features
- **Consistent design language** across platforms

**Key Components Used:**
- ion-tabs for bottom navigation
- ion-card for content containers
- ion-fab for floating action buttons
- ion-button with proper touch targets
