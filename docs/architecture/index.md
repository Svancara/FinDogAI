## üéØ Quick Navigation

### For AI Assistants
Start with [Data Models](./data-models.md) and [API Specification](./api-specification.md) to understand the system structure.

### For Frontend Developers
Focus on [Components](./components.md), [Tech Stack](./tech-stack.md), [Coding Standards](./coding-standards.md), and [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md).

### For Backend Developers
Prioritize [API Specification](./api-specification.md), [Data Models](./data-models.md), [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md), and [Deployment](./deployment.md).

### For DevOps Engineers
See [Deployment](./deployment.md), [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md), [Project Structure](./project-structure.md), and [Development Workflow](./development-workflow.md).

### For QA Engineers
Start with [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md), then review [Tech Stack](./tech-stack.md) and [Deployment](./deployment.md) for CI/CD integration.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles

1. **Offline-First** - Full functionality without connectivity
2. **Voice-Driven** - Natural language interaction as primary interface
3. **Type-Safe** - Shared TypeScript definitions across the stack
4. **Serverless** - Auto-scaling with pay-per-use model
5. **Multi-Tenant** - Secure data isolation at database level
