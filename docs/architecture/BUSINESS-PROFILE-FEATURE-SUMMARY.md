# Business Profile Resource Visibility Feature - Architecture Update Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Feature:** Business Profile Settings for Resource Type UI Visibility
**Status:** Architecture Complete âœ…
**Version:** v1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Overview

This feature adds three toggle switches to the Business Profile settings that allow business owners to hide UI elements for resource types they don't use:

- **Working with machines** (controls machine-related UI)
- **Using vehicles** (controls vehicle/transport-related UI)
- **Other business expenses** (controls expense-related UI)

**Rationale:** Simplify the UI for users who don't need all resource types, while preserving existing data and maintaining the auto-selection logic for single resources.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Architecture Changes Summary

### 1. Data Models Updated âœ…
**File:** `docs/architecture/data-models.md`

Added **Business Profile Model** with three new fields:
```typescript
interface BusinessProfile {
  // ... existing fields
  usesMachines: boolean;      // Default: true
  usesVehicles: boolean;      // Default: true
  usesOtherExpenses: boolean; // Default: true
}
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Defaults to `true` for all flags (show all by default)
- Non-destructive (existing resources remain in database)
- Team member UI is NEVER hidden (business owner always exists)

### 2. Components Architecture Updated âœ…
**File:** `docs/architecture/components.md`

Added **Business Profile Service** component:
- `shouldShowResourceType(type): Observable<boolean>` - Reactive visibility control
- `getBusinessProfile(): Observable<BusinessProfile>` - Stream profile changes
- `updateBusinessProfile(updates): Promise<void>` - Update configuration

**UI Visibility Control Logic:**
- `usesMachines: false` â†’ Hide machine buttons, tabs, cost types, filters
- `usesVehicles: false` â†’ Hide vehicle buttons, tabs, cost types, filters
- `usesOtherExpenses: false` â†’ Hide expense buttons, cost types, filters
- Team members â†’ ALWAYS visible

### 3. PRD Epic 2.5 Enhanced âœ…
**File:** `docs/prd/epic-2-core-data-management-business-setup.md`

Updated **Story 2.5: Business Profile Configuration** with:
- New "My business involves:" section with three toggles
- 16 detailed acceptance criteria covering all UI changes
- Help text for users
- Reactive update behavior

### 4. Coding Standards Enhanced âœ…
**File:** `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`

Added new section: **Conditional UI Rendering Based on Business Profile**

**Updates Made:**
- âœ… Updated to use modern `@if` control flow (Angular 17+) instead of `*ngIf`
- âœ… Added `@if` to Critical Fullstack Rules
- âœ… Complete `BusinessProfileService` implementation example
- âœ… Template examples with `@if` and async pipe
- âœ… 7 key rules for developers

**Template Pattern:**
```typescript
@if (showVehicles$ | async) {
  <ion-tab-button tab="vehicles">
    <ion-label>Vehicles</ion-label>
  </ion-tab-button>
}
```

### 5. API Specification Extended âœ…
**File:** `docs/architecture/api-specification.md`

Added **Business Profile API** section:
- TypeScript service interface
- Complete validation rules
- Firebase Security Rules for Business Profile document
- Owner-only update permissions
- Field validation at security rule level

### 6. Migration Guide Created âœ…
**File:** `docs/architecture/business-profile-migration.md`

Comprehensive migration guide including:
- Database migration strategies (Cloud Function and Admin Script)
- Validation queries
- Security rules updates
- Testing checklist
- Rollback plan
- 4-week migration timeline

### 7. Implementation Checklist Created âœ…
**File:** `docs/architecture/business-profile-implementation-checklist.md`

Complete developer roadmap with 9 phases:
1. Shared Types & Models (2 hours)
2. Backend Implementation (4 hours)
3. Frontend Services (6 hours)
4. UI Components (12 hours)
5. State Management (6 hours)
6. Testing (8 hours)
7. Documentation (4 hours)
8. Deployment (3 hours)
9. Validation & Monitoring (2 hours)

**Total Estimated Effort:** ~47 hours (~6 days)

### 8. Architecture Index Updated âœ…
**File:** `docs/architecture/index.md`

Added new "Feature-Specific Guides" section linking to:
- Business Profile Migration Guide
- Business Profile Implementation Checklist

## ðŸ”‘ Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Default all flags to true** | Show all features by default; opt-out rather than opt-in |
| **Non-destructive hiding** | Preserve existing data; only affect UI visibility |
| **Team members always visible** | Business owner always exists as team member #1 |
| **Reactive updates** | Use RxJS observables for immediate UI propagation |
| **Owner-only control** | Only business owners can modify these settings |
| **Security rule validation** | Enforce data integrity at database level |
| **@if control flow** | Use modern Angular 17+ syntax instead of *ngIf |

## ðŸ“Š Impact Analysis

### Database Impact
- **Schema Change:** 3 new boolean fields added to Business Profile
- **Migration Required:** Yes (all existing tenants need default values)
- **Breaking Changes:** None (backward compatible)
- **Data Size Impact:** Minimal (+24 bytes per tenant)

### Frontend Impact
- **New Service:** BusinessProfileService
- **Updated Components:** Settings, Resources, Costs, Voice flows
- **State Management:** New Business Profile feature state
- **Bundle Size:** Estimated +5KB gzipped

### Backend Impact
- **Security Rules:** Updated with validation for new fields
- **Cloud Functions:** New migration function (one-time)
- **Triggers:** Updated tenant creation to include new fields

### User Experience Impact
- **Simplified UI:** Users without certain resources see cleaner interface
- **No data loss:** Existing resources preserved even when hidden
- **Immediate feedback:** Changes apply instantly (reactive)
- **Help text:** Clear explanation of what toggles do
