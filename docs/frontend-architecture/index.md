## Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for the FinDogAI frontend architecture built with Angular 20+, Ionic Framework 8+, and NgRx for state management. The application is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline-first capabilities, optimized for field workers using voice commands.

### Key Features

- **Offline-First Architecture**: Full functionality without internet connectivity
- **Voice Command Pipeline**: Hands-free operation for field workers
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Isolated data per construction business
- **Real-Time Sync**: Firestore integration with conflict resolution
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Touch-friendly interface for challenging conditions
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable, app-like experience

## Architecture Sections

### Core Architecture

1. **[Frontend Tech Stack](./tech-stack.md)**
   - Technology choices and versions
   - Dependencies and rationale
   - Monorepo tooling (Nx, Angular CLI, Vite)

2. **[Project Structure](./project-structure.md)**
   - Monorepo organization
   - Feature module layout
   - Shared libraries and utilities
   - Naming conventions

3. **[Component Standards](./component-standards.md)**
   - Component templates and patterns
   - Naming conventions
   - Dependency injection with inject()
   - Signals and reactive patterns

### State and Data Management

4. **[State Management](./state-management.md)**
   - Complete NgRx implementation
   - Actions, reducers, effects, selectors
   - Entity adapters for normalized state
   - Offline state handling

5. **[API Integration](./api-integration.md)**
   - Cloud Functions integration
   - HTTP interceptors (Auth, Offline)
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Request/response type safety

### Application Features

6. **[Routing](./routing.md)**
   - Route configuration
   - Guards (Auth, Tenant, Role, PendingChanges)
   - Resolvers for data preloading
   - Lazy loading strategy

7. **[Offline Architecture](./offline-architecture.md)**
   - Network Status Service
   - Sync Queue Service
   - Firestore Sync with conflict resolution
   - Optimistic UI updates

### UI and Design

8. **[Styling Guidelines](./styling-guidelines.md)**
   - Theme system configuration
   - CSS custom properties
   - Dark mode support
   - Touch-friendly design patterns
   - Component-specific styling

### Quality Assurance

9. **[Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md)**
   - Unit testing with Jest
   - Integration testing patterns
   - E2E testing with Playwright
   - Testing best practices
   - Coverage goals

### Deployment and Performance

10. **[Performance Optimization](./performance-optimization.md)**
    - Bundle size optimization
    - Runtime performance
    - PWA optimization strategies
    - Lazy loading and code splitting

11. **[Deployment Configuration](./deployment-configuration.md)**
    - Environment configuration
    - Build configuration
    - Capacitor setup
    - CI/CD considerations

## Quick Start

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
nx serve mobile-app

# Run tests
nx test mobile-app

# Build for production
nx build mobile-app --configuration=production
```

### Key Conventions

- **Standalone Components**: All components use Angular's standalone API
- **Signals**: Reactive state management using Angular signals
- **Dependency Injection**: Use `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
- **Offline-First**: Always consider offline scenarios
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration enforced

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier configured
- 80%+ test coverage for business logic
- All code reviewed before merging

### Accessibility
- No formal WCAG compliance target
- Touch targets minimum 48x48px
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation

### Security
- Firebase authentication and rules
- Secure environment variable handling
- Input sanitization
- Regular security audits

## Team Collaboration

- Branch naming: `feature/JIRA-123-description`
- Commit format: Conventional Commits
- All PRs require code review
- Documentation updated with code changes
