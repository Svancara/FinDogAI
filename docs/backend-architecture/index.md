## Introduction

### Purpose

This documentation provides comprehensive architectural specifications for the FinDogAI backend system, a serverless Firebase-based infrastructure supporting a voice-first mobile application for craftsmen to capture job costs hands-free.

### Scope

The backend architecture covers:
- Firebase services configuration and integration
- Firestore data model and multi-tenant isolation
- Cloud Functions architecture and implementation
- Security rules and authentication patterns
- API integration and connectivity
- Performance optimization strategies
- Deployment and operational procedures

### Audience

- Backend developers implementing Cloud Functions
- Frontend developers integrating Firebase SDK
- DevOps engineers managing deployment pipelines
- Security auditors reviewing GDPR compliance
- Product managers understanding technical constraints

### Architectural Principles

1. **Offline-First**: Firestore offline persistence ensures app functionality without network
2. **Client-Heavy**: Business logic resides primarily in the mobile app
3. **Serverless**: Cloud Functions handle only server-side operations (sequential IDs, audit logging, PDF generation)
4. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Security Rules enforce tenant-level data segregation
5. **GDPR Compliance**: All data stored in EU region (europe-west1) with export/deletion support
6. **Cost Optimization**: Minimize Cloud Functions invocations; leverage free tier where possible
7. **Graceful Degradation**: Voice features degrade to manual entry when offline
