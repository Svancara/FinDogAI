## MVP Critical Path

**Minimum viable product in 6 weeks focusing on:**

1. âœ… Basic auth and tenant creation
2. âœ… Job management (create, list, update)
3. âœ… Cost entry with materials only
4. âœ… Basic voice commands (navigation only)
5. âœ… Offline support for core operations
6. âœ… PWA deployment

## Risk Mitigation Items

- [ ] Implement rate limiting for LLM APIs
- [ ] Add fallback for voice services
- [ ] Create data backup strategy
- [ ] Plan for Firebase cost monitoring
- [ ] Design tenant data migration strategy
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers for external services

## Success Metrics to Track

- [ ] Time to first job creation
- [ ] Voice command success rate
- [ ] Offline/online sync reliability
- [ ] Page load performance
- [ ] User retention rate
- [ ] Error rate monitoring

## Priority Legend

- ðŸ”´ **Critical** - Must have for MVP
- ðŸŸ¡ **Important** - Should have for full release
- ðŸŸ¢ **Nice to have** - Can be added post-launch

## Development Tips

1. **Start with shared packages** - They're dependencies for everything else
2. **Test offline scenarios early** - It's harder to add offline support later
3. **Use Firebase emulators** - Faster development and no cloud costs
4. **Implement auth early** - Many features depend on user context
5. **Keep voice features modular** - Easy to disable if APIs are unavailable
