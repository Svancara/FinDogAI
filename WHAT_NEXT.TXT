DRUHA HLASKA:
The document now provides comprehensive guidance for frontend development of the FinDogAI application.

----------------------------------
PRVNI HLASKA:
Now that we have the complete Frontend Architecture Document, here are the logical next steps:

  What's Next?

  1. Backend Architecture Document (create-backend-architecture)

  Since you have the frontend architecture complete, you'll need the backend counterpart covering:
  - Cloud Functions implementation
  - Firestore security rules
  - Firebase Auth configuration
  - Sequence allocation service
  - PDF generation service
  - Voice command processing

  2. Start Implementation (shard-prd)

  Break down your PRD into actionable development tasks:
  - Create epics and user stories
  - Generate development tickets
  - Prioritize implementation order

  3. Document the Full Project (document-project)

  Create comprehensive documentation of your current project state, including:
  - Current implementation status
  - Integration points
  - Development setup guide

  4. Create Full-Stack Architecture (create-full-stack-architecture)

  Combine frontend and backend into a unified architecture document showing:
  - End-to-end data flow
  - Integration patterns
  - Deployment strategy

  5. Run Architecture Checklist (execute-checklist)

  Validate your architecture against best practices:
  - Security review
  - Performance optimization opportunities
  - Scalability assessment

  6. Research Specific Topics (research {topic})

  Deep dive into specific areas like:
  - Voice pipeline optimization
  - Offline sync strategies
  - PWA best practices

  My Recommendation: Since you have the frontend architecture done, I'd suggest either:
  - Option 1: Create the backend architecture (type 1 or create-backend-architecture) to complete your technical documentation
  - Option 2: Shard the PRD (type 2 or shard-prd) to start breaking down the work into implementable chunks

  Which would you like to tackle next?
