## VALIDATION METHODOLOGY

Documents analyzed:
- `docs/prd/requirements.md` - All 25 FRs and 15 NFRs
- `docs/architecture/` - 22 architecture specification documents
- `docs/frontend-architecture/index.md` - Frontend architecture overview
- `docs/backend-architecture/index.md` - Backend architecture overview

Validation approach: For each requirement, identified:
1. Which architecture document(s) address it
2. Technical approach sufficiency
3. Implementation gaps or concerns
4. Specific file/line references
