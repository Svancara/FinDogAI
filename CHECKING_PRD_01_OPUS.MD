# FinDogAI PRD Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of the FinDogAI Product Requirements Document (PRD). The analysis identified several critical issues related to data model inconsistencies, security concerns, and technical implementation conflicts. While the PRD is generally well-structured and comprehensive, it requires attention to resolve contradictions and clarify ambiguous requirements before development proceeds.

**Overall Assessment:** The PRD is **75% complete** with significant issues requiring resolution before MVP development.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Data Model Inconsistency - Resource References vs. Copies

**Location:** Epic 2 Introduction vs. FR3 and Data Model sections

**Problem:** The PRD contains a fundamental contradiction about how costs and events reference resources:
- **Epic 2** explicitly states: "Costs and Events collections will NEVER use references to resources... they will store complete copies of resource data"
- **FR3** states: costs have "resourceId" field
- **Data Model** (line 291) shows costs with "resourceId" field

**Impact:** This is a critical architectural decision that affects:
- Database design and storage costs
- Referential integrity
- Historical data accuracy
- Query complexity

**Recommendation:** Clarify and consistently apply one approach throughout:
- Option A: Store complete resource snapshots (better for audit trail, higher storage cost)
- Option B: Use references with careful deletion handling (lower storage, requires integrity checks)

### 2. User-Tenant Mapping Confusion

**Location:** Lines 321-349, Story 1.3, Story 1.3a

**Problem:** The PRD describes multiple overlapping approaches for user-tenant mapping:
- Direct mapping at `/user_tenants/{uid}`
- Index collection at `/user_tenants/{uid}/memberships/{tenantId}`
- Confusion about which is primary and when each is used

**Impact:** Authentication flow complexity, potential for orphaned users, unclear tenant switching mechanism

**Recommendation:** Simplify to a single clear approach:
- Use `/user_tenants/{uid}/memberships/{tenantId}` as the primary index
- Document the exact flow for single vs. multi-tenant scenarios
- Clarify how active tenant selection works

### 3. Voice Feature Offline Behavior Contradiction

**Location:** FR13, FR20, Story 3.2, Story 3.6

**Problem:** Inconsistent descriptions of offline voice behavior:
- Some sections say voice is "disabled" offline
- Others mention "queueing" audio
- Platform-native TTS mentioned for offline but also stated as requiring connectivity

**Impact:** User experience confusion, unclear technical requirements

**Recommendation:** Clearly define a single offline strategy:
- Voice commands are completely disabled offline (recommended for MVP)
- Clear user messaging about manual fallback
- Remove references to audio queueing if not implemented

---

## Major Issues

### 4. PDF Generation Scope Confusion

**Location:** FR14, Epic 6, Story 6.1

**Problem:** PDF generation is marked as "Phase 2" but included in Epic 6 which is part of the MVP scope

**Impact:** Scope creep risk, timeline confusion

**Recommendation:** Either:
- Remove Story 6.1 from Epic 6 entirely
- Clearly mark Epic 6 as split between MVP and Phase 2 components

### 5. Sequential ID Allocation Complexity

**Location:** FR18, Story 1.2b, multiple references

**Problem:** The sequential ID system has multiple allocation paths that could conflict:
- Online via HTTPS callable
- Offline via onCreate triggers
- Different sequences at tenant and job levels

**Impact:** Risk of duplicate IDs, race conditions, complex error handling

**Recommendation:** Simplify to a single allocation mechanism:
- Always use onCreate triggers for consistency
- Accept gaps in sequences for simplicity
- Add explicit duplicate detection and resolution

### 6. Privilege Model Incomplete

**Location:** FR11, Story 2.4, Story 5.4

**Problem:** The privilege model is oversimplified:
- Only two toggles (canAddCosts, canViewFinancials)
- No job-specific permissions
- Owner protection rules unclear for multi-owner scenarios

**Impact:** May not meet real-world business needs

**Recommendation:** Document clear limitations and future expansion path

### 7. Audit Log Retention vs. GDPR

**Location:** FR8, FR23, NFR11

**Problem:** Conflict between audit log retention (1 year) and GDPR right-to-erasure:
- FR23 mentions cascade delete including audit logs
- But audit logs might be needed for compliance
- Legal requirements not clearly defined

**Impact:** Potential GDPR non-compliance

**Recommendation:** Consult legal counsel and clarify:
- Which data must be deleted vs. anonymized
- Audit log retention requirements
- Implement data anonymization instead of deletion where appropriate

---

## Minor Issues

### 8. Voice Provider Configuration

**Location:** Story 2.6, Story 3.1

**Problem:** Voice provider configuration exposed in Person Profile UI but marked as "for developers"

**Impact:** User confusion, potential for misconfiguration

**Recommendation:** Move to developer settings or environment configuration only

### 9. Wake Word Implementation

**Location:** FR16, FR20

**Problem:** Wake word detection mentioned but not fully specified:
- No clear specification of which library/service
- Hands-free confirmation flow not fully detailed

**Impact:** Implementation ambiguity

**Recommendation:** Specify exact wake word detection service and interaction flow

### 10. Currency and VAT Rate Validation

**Location:** Story 2.5

**Problem:** VAT rate validation "0-100%" but no validation for currency codes mentioned

**Impact:** Potential for invalid data entry

**Recommendation:** Add explicit ISO 4217 validation for currency codes

### 11. Team Member Deletion

**Location:** Story 2.4

**Problem:** Confusion between deleting team member resource vs. revoking membership

**Impact:** Unclear user flow

**Recommendation:** Clarify that these are separate operations with different permissions

### 12. Distance Unit Immutability

**Location:** Story 2.2

**Problem:** Distance unit is copied to vehicles at creation and marked immutable, but business profile can change

**Impact:** Inconsistent distance units across vehicles

**Recommendation:** Either make business profile distance unit immutable or allow vehicle updates

---

## Missing Information

### 13. Error Recovery Patterns

**Location:** Throughout

**Problem:** No consistent error recovery pattern defined for:
- Network failures during multi-step operations
- Partial sync failures
- Voice pipeline interruptions

**Recommendation:** Define standard error recovery patterns and retry strategies

### 14. Performance Metrics

**Location:** NFR section

**Problem:** Performance targets defined but no monitoring or measurement strategy

**Recommendation:** Add requirement for performance monitoring and alerting

### 15. Testing Data Requirements

**Location:** Testing Requirements section

**Problem:** No mention of test data generation or management

**Recommendation:** Add requirements for test data fixtures and seeding

---

## Security Concerns

### 16. API Key Management

**Location:** Story 3.1

**Problem:** API keys stored in .env files but no key rotation strategy

**Impact:** Security risk if keys are compromised

**Recommendation:** Implement secure key storage and rotation strategy

### 17. Invite Code Security

**Location:** Story 1.7, 1.8

**Problem:** Invite codes/links security not fully specified:
- No rate limiting details
- No brute force protection
- TTL of 72h might be too long

**Recommendation:** Add specific security requirements:
- Rate limiting per IP/user
- Exponential backoff for failed attempts
- Shorter TTL (24h recommended)

### 18. Voice Data Privacy

**Location:** Voice pipeline stories

**Problem:** No mention of voice data retention or privacy

**Impact:** GDPR compliance risk

**Recommendation:** Add requirements for:
- Voice recording deletion after processing
- User consent for voice data processing
- Voice data encryption in transit

---

## Technical Feasibility Concerns

### 19. Voice Recognition Accuracy Targets

**Location:** NFR5, NFR6

**Problem:** Czech voice recognition accuracy targets may be optimistic:
- WER â‰¤15% median for Czech might be challenging
- No mention of dialect variations

**Impact:** User satisfaction if targets not met

**Recommendation:** Start with more conservative targets and improve iteratively

### 20. Offline Sync Complexity

**Location:** Story 6.3

**Problem:** LWW conflict resolution might lose important data

**Impact:** User frustration with lost changes

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing:
- Conflict preview before resolution
- Manual conflict resolution option for critical data
- Better change tracking/history

## Conclusion

The FinDogAI PRD is a solid foundation that demonstrates good understanding of the problem domain and user needs. However, it requires resolution of several critical technical contradictions before development can proceed safely. The most urgent issues relate to the data model architecture and offline behavior specifications.

With the recommended changes, this PRD would provide a clear roadmap for building a successful MVP. The development team should prioritize resolving the critical and major issues before beginning implementation to avoid costly architectural changes later.

**Next Steps:**
1. Schedule a technical review meeting to resolve critical issues
2. Update PRD with clarifications and corrections
3. Create technical design documents for complex components
4. Establish clear Phase 1 (MVP) vs. Phase 2 boundaries
